unknown: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in admin_login.php in MCshoutbox 1.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the loginerror parameter.
unknown: Unspecified vulnerability in the Service Advertisement Framework (SAF) in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (aka CUCM, formerly CallManager) 8.x before 8.5(1) and Cisco Intercompany Media Engine 8.x before 8.5(1) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via crafted SAF packets, aka Bug ID CSCth19417.
unknown: Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the Zidget/HTTP embedded HTTP server in ExtremeZ-IP File and Print Server 5.1.2x15 and earlier allow remote attackers to read arbitrary (1) gif, (2) png, (3) jpg, (4) xml, (5) ico, (6) zip, and (7) html files via a "..\" (dot dot backslash) sequence in the filename.
exploited: Adobe Flash Player before 10.3.181.14 on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris and before 10.3.185.21 on Android allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via crafted Flash content, as possibly exploited in the wild in May 2011 by a Microsoft Office document with an embedded .swf file.
not_exploited: There are no known XSS vectors at the moment, but should one be discovered, this vulnerability would allow the XSS attack to completely bypass CSP.
not_exploited: At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of the security vulnerability was known.
unknown: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the No indexed Search (no_indexed_search) extension 0.2.0 for TYPO3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
exploited: The Van Ons WP GDPR Compliance (aka wp-gdpr-compliance) plugin before 1.4.3 for WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because $wpdb->prepare() input is mishandled, as exploited in the wild in November 2018.
unknown: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in guestbook.php in my little homepage my little guestbook, as last modified in March 2004, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript via a javascript URI in BBcode link tags.
exploited: Use-after-free vulnerability in the CRecordInstance::TransferToDestination function in mshtml.dll in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 6, 6 SP1, and 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via DSO bindings involving (1) an XML Island, (2) XML DSOs, or (3) Tabular Data Control (TDC) in a crafted HTML or XML document, as demonstrated by nested SPAN or MARQUEE elements, and exploited in the wild in December 2008.
unknown: Buffer overflow in ASP Server-Side Include Function in IIS 4.0, 5.0 and 5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via long file names.
unknown: Integer overflow in the _IO_wstr_overflow function in libio/wstrops.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to computing a size in bytes, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
exploited: It's been observed that ttmd.exe terminates as a result.
exploited: Off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in Compress::Raw::Zlib Perl module before 2.017, as used in AMaViS, SpamAssassin, and possibly other products, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (hang or crash) via a crafted zlib compressed stream that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild by Trojan.Downloader-71014 in June 2009.
unknown: PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in confirmUnsubscription.php in NmnNewsletter 1.0.7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the output parameter.
unknown: Integer overflow in ds.dlm, as used by dhost.exe, in Novell eDirectory 8.7.3.10 before 8.7.3 SP10b and 8.8 before 8.8.2 ftf2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, related to "flawed arithmetic."
unknown: Macromedia Flash Player before 7,0,19,0 stores a Flash data file in a predictable location that is accessible to web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Opera, which allows remote attackers to read restricted files via vulnerabilities in web browsers whose exploits rely on predictable names.
exploited: The Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol implementation in the IPv6 stack in Cisco IOS XE 2.1 through 3.17S, IOS XR 2.0.0 through 5.3.2, and NX-OS allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (packet-processing outage) via crafted ND messages, aka Bug ID CSCuz66542, as exploited in the wild in May 2016.
unknown: The DrawImage function in magick/render.c in GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 does not properly look for pop keywords that are associated with push keywords, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (negative strncpy and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
exploited: The attacks exploiting this vulnerability have been observed.
unknown: A specially crafted PDF document can trigger an out-of-bounds read, which can disclose sensitive memory content and aid in exploitation when coupled with another vulnerability.
unknown: SQL injection vulnerability in the weblinks option (weblinks.html.php) in Limbo CMS allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the catid parameter.
